# Stock Price Prediction and Visualization

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict the future trend (up or down) of a stock based on historical price data. It also includes a candlestick chart visualization of historical stock prices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, yfinance, plotly, sklearn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy yfinance plotly scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/isougatadas/Machine-Learning/Stock Prediction/Stock Prediction using ML.git
```
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd stock-price-prediction
```
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
2. Customize the code for your specific stock symbol and dataset.
3. Run the code to perform stock price prediction and visualization.

## Usage
-- Data Collection: The code downloads historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. Make sure to specify the desired stock symbol, start date, and end date in the code.
-- Feature Engineering: Additional features such as price change and price change percentage are calculated based on historical data.
-- Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained to predict the future trend of the stock based on historical features.
-- Visualization: The code generates a candlestick chart using Plotly to visualize historical stock prices.
-- Prediction: You can use the trained model to predict the future trend for a new data point by specifying the feature values.
